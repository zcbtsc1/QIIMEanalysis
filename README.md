# Chicago plus Gordon Square analysis
In the chicago plus gordon square folder all the scripts used to analyse the data downloaded from the study done by Wang et al 2018 in Chicago can be found. 
These scripts include analyses in which the data from Chicago was joined with our data. 
After the first step (qualityfiltering) the seqs.fna files from both studies were joined and all the following scripts include the sequences from both studies.
As in the previous folder, the numbers in the file names indicate the order in which the scripts were executed.
Additionally, the two map files I used are included.
